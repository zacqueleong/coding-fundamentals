                            <p>Hi! I am Zacque (pronounced as Zac, the "que" is silent), originating from Penang but has spend almost my entire life living in the bustling capital city of Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur.</p>
                            <p>Here are is a quick summary on my career so far:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Graduated from APU, with Bachelor's Degree in IT, majoring in Forensic Computing.</li>
                                <li>Worked as Programmer Analyst for a outsourcing powerhouse in Petaling Jaya and was outsourced to a few key takaful/insurance companies in Malaysia, participated in software integration project/deployment.</li>
                                <li>Picked up the knowledge on coding in COBOL on AS/400 mainframe systems, the bread and butter of my job involves maintaining/bug-fixing/enhancing/writing new batch programs and to provide BAU(Business As Usual) support as required.</li>
                                <li>Gained a few years experience, moved on as a Senior Application Developer, working directly in a P&C insurance company in-house application team.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The grass is always greener on the other side as you may say, despite having knowledge on coding in COBOL on AS/400 mainframe systems, which many may consider it as niche and even a valuable skill; it did not provide much in career opportunities and flexibility that i yearn. 
                            <p>I have always been keen on exploring modern web development and to transition myself as a web developer.</p>
                            <p>Sigma School would be my transition point.</p>
