1. 
We need loops to help iterate segments of our code which we want to run again and over again.

We write a basic for loop starting with the 'for' statement followed by 3 parameters.

Parameter 1: Initialisation Code, that will be executed before the loop starts (For example, set the initial counter)
Parameter 2: Condition for executing the loop (This will be checked on each code execution / iteration)
Parameter 3: Code to execute after the whole for loop block has been executed. (For example, To increment or to decrement the counter)

Example of a for loop, that will loop 5 times.

for (let i = 1; i <= 5 ; i++){
    console.log(`Loop # : ${i}`);
}

2.
console.log is used to display values on console
return is used to return a specific value/function within a function block

3. 
truthy values are values that are evaluated with result of true through Boolean() function
falsy values are values  that are evaluated with result of false through Boolean() function

4. 
The internet works by having a large global network of computers connected. 
The established network allows data packets to be transferred between the computers connected.
Communication between client and server is done through the a standard known as the Internet Protocol.

5.
The website work when we enter the internet link/address through our browser.
The browser sends request to the server which hosts the webpage of the website that we want to access.
When connection is established, the server will return the requested files required to load the website.

The files involved to load a website generally includes but not limited to:
i) html file (for the structure of the page)
ii) css file (for the styling of the page)
iii) javascript file (for the dynamic interaction with the page)
